# Build You A Markov Chain In Rust (Or Whatever)

## AKA 65 Line Markov Chain (A Rewrite)

I've found that if you can translate something into Rust, you pretty much understand it.  In that spirit, this post covers a translation of the program in [this post](http://theorangeduck.com/page/17-line-markov-chain) by [orangeduck](http://theorangeduck.com/page/about) in Rust, with a little extra explanation.  You should be able to knock one out in whatever you like after!

A [Markov chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) can be used to generate realistic(ish) sounding random text based on a sample input.  The Wikipedia article is somewhat opaque, as Wikipedia can tends to be, but at it's heart it's a very simple concept in which the next word is chosen based entirely on the current two words.  It's surprisingly simple (at least, I was surprised at how easy it was) and yet generates some real-sounding(ish) text with minimal effort.

You shouldn't need to know Rust to follow along.

### On Your Marks

If you're just here for the Markov Chain algorithm and not the Rust, skip down to the **Markov** section.

This project requires stable [Rust](https://rustup.rs/).  Go there to get it if you need, and then spin up a project:

```
$ cargo new markov
$ cd markov/
```

### Get Set

Before hopping in, a quick 'n' dirty CLI would be nice for playing around with different inputs.  Luckily, Rust has a great option in [structopt](https://github.com/TeXitoi/structopt).  From the project root:

```
$ cargo add structopt
```

As the name implies this crate makes it easy to define an interface by simply defining a struct.  Add the following to the top of `src/main.rs`:

```rust
use std::{error::Error, path::PathBuf, str::FromStr};
use structopt::StructOpt;

#[derive(StructOpt, Debug)]
#[structopt(name = "markov")]
struct Opt {
    /// Input text file
    #[structopt(short = "i", long = "input")]
    input: Option<PathBuf>,
    /// Output length
    #[structopt(short = "l", long = "length")]
    length: Option<u32>,
}
```

The doc comments with the three slashes end up in the help string this crate will generate for us.  An example format for this struct would be something like `./markov -i poetry.txt -l 500`.  The long names are used with two dashes, like `--length`.  We type each as `Option<T>`, which means if either is omitted when the program is invoked this struct will just hold a `None`.  A `PathBuf` is a fancy owned `String` with [cross-platform path abstractions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/path/index.html) built in.  You can `push` to them and traverse them the same way on whichever platform your code runs.

Now, replace the template `println!` call given in `main()` with:

```rust
fn main() {
    let opt = Opt::from_args();
    let filename = opt
        .input
        .unwrap_or(PathBuf::from_str("poetry.txt").unwrap());
    let length = opt.length.unwrap_or(350);

    if let Err(e) = run(filename, length) {
        eprintln!("Error: {}", e);
        ::std::process::exit(1);
    };
}
```

If you're not new to Rust, that's probably fine and dandy.  If you are, let's unpack it a little.

First, we generate the struct itself from whatever was passed on the command line.  For the example from above, we now have:

```rust
Opt(
    input: Some(PathBuf(inner: "poetry.txt")),
    length: Some(350u32),
)
```

All in-memory data structures will be presented in [RON](https://github.com/ron-rs/ron).  Note that the guts of `PathBuf` are omitted - it's an [`OsString`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ffi/struct.OsString.html) if you're curious but we just care it's a `PathBuf`.

The first thing to do is get something more concrete from those options to pass in to the program.  Using `unwrap_or()` is a great way to do this.  If the value is a `Some(thing)` it returns `thing`, and if it's `None` it returns the passed argument.

That `from_str` call we do to get our default `"poetry.txt"` `&str` value into a `PathBuf` is part of the `FromStr` and only works when that [trait](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-02-traits.html) is in scope.  It's an operation that can fail - for example, with a malformed path - so it returns a `Result<T, E>`.  You can get at the `T` of those with `unwrap()` if you're sure you'll have one.  We know this one won't fail because we just made the input ourselves and it's not a malformed path, just a filename with an extension.  If you don't have something valid this will panic and crash.  It's almost always better to use something like `unwrap_or()`  or [pattern matching](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-02-match.html) to deal with the alternative cleanly!

Next we pass both in to an error-checked function.  It's good practice to take advantage of Rust's error handling for as much of your program as possible - this is a good way to force it!

Of course, we need a `run()` function.  Here's a stub, just to get us to compile:

```rust
fn run(input: PathBuf, length: u32) -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    Ok(())
}
```

The meat of our program isn't going to need to deal with those options, and we return a `Result<(), Box<Error>`.  Our success type, `()` stands for `unit` which is the or the empty tuple or `void`.  `Box<dyn Error>` merits a little more explaining.  A [`Box<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/index.html) is a boxed value - a basic heap-allocated value of type `T`.  Specifically the `Box` is a pointer to it, but a Rust-y smart pointer that knows about ownership and borrowing.  It's got a big name but it's just a pointer, nothing else.  This is useful because the `Box` has a size known at compile time, even if the value it points to may not.  The thing in the box with the `dyn Trait` syntax is a [*trait object*](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch17-02-trait-objects.html).  `Error` from `std::error` is a trait that many types implement.  Using `dyn Error` we cover any type that implements the `Error` trait. This allows us to pass and catch many different types of errors in one function easily.

If you're brand new to Rust and that was a little too breezy, you're in for a real treat outside the scope of this post but don't worry - this part isn't necessary to understand the Markov bits below!  It's just some Rust boilerplate for clean and happy error handling without much setup.

Let's fire it up!  See if the help string is working with:

```
$ cargo run -- -h
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.04s
     Running `target/debug/markov -h`
markov 0.1.0
you <you@you.cool>

USAGE:
    markov [OPTIONS]

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -i, --input <input>      Input text file
    -l, --length <length>    Output length
```

Groovy!  Thanks, structopt.  Don't forget:

```
$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

### Markov!

This is my favorite run so far on the poetry set:

```
$ cargo run --release
   Compiling markov v0.1.0 (/home/ben/code/markov)
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.58s
     Running `target/release/markov`
An actor experiences
Other peoples lives
Through a metamorphosis of mind

Words sifted through a Forest, beneath the blowing gale,
The waves have now the year of 1897, and on like that.
I can't abear it. I killed last night.

I wonder, 'struth, I wonder if the listener please,
A most important thing;
But Fortune to a thousand times, but I
 Would have him with his prophetic bill.
The great Colosse, erect to Memory;
And what the royal feast!
See here the blue night, railway stations.

The water and fire his courage on despair
And utter dissolution, as the love of slaughter;
Many indeed are the men
With spears gathering at his feet: and my evening hours.

Last evening when it rests,
Leaves to be
Of work may be shared by not crossing the line,
Though that same morning officers and men.

Continues yet the dream
```

Continues, yet, the dream...
